          <h3>Who is BulldogClip for?</h3>
          <p>Although BulldogClip was designed for small businesses and sole-traders to capture their costs, it has also proved useful for individuals who just wish to track their household spending. If you currently battle every month to keep track of your costs using spreadsheets, create invoices using a word processor and add everything up with a calculator, BulldogClip will put a smile back on your face.</p>

            <h3>Why is it called BulldogClip</h3>
            <p>A bulldog clip is a simple and effective way of storing bills, just like BulldogClip. When you get back from the shops you can keep all your reciepts neatly together in a bulldog clip until you are ready to process them onto the BulldogClip software.</p>

            <p>We don't have an app for BulldogClip. However the software has been designed to work on a tablet device as well as on your desktop computer.</p>

        <h3>Why bills?</h3>
        <p>Most of what you are likely to record in BulldogClip are not strictly speaking 'bills'. They will often be receipts, till receipts, credit card transaction advice notes, or even invoices. Bill is a short and friendly name. That's why we use it. Not to be 'correct' but to be simple and effective, like a bulldog clip.</p>

          <p>We have a range of plans to suit both business and personal users. All our plans come with a 30 day free trial. The current subscription plans are shown on our <%= link_to 'pricing page', plans_path, class: 'faq-link', id: 'ga_faq_1' %>.</p>

      <div class="row spacer" id="why_cost">
          <h3>Why isn't it free?</h3>
          <p>Sadly there are costs to running any online application. Many of these costs vary with the number of users. To allow us to keep it running, it must at least cover those costs. To keep it simple, effective and friendly to use, we don't want to introduce advertising which gets in the way. </p><br>
          <p>We hope that you will agree that it is a reasonable cost and easily covered by the saving in your time. If you run a small business and have to record expenses or if you use BulldogClip to reclaim expenses, you could be saving hours of your time each month. </p><br>
          <p>If you just want to use BulldogClip to track where your money is going, you will be amazed what insights you can achieve, even if you don't track every last penny. </p><br>
          <p>We believe that we will need to charge it every year, not just as a one off payment, because the unavoidable costs of running the system also happen every year. Our 30 day no obligation free trial is designed to give you a chance to see the benefits for yourself before you are committed to any payments.</p>

      <div class="row spacer" id="vat">
          <h3>Does BulldogClip support VAT?</h3>
          <p>Yes. The business plan allows you to create VAT rates and to
          record VAT on your bills. It does not calculate the amount of VAT for
          you but does add it up and summarise it by rate on invoices, as
          required by HMRC.</p>
          <p>The primary driver for adding this was to support reclaiming of
          VAT on business expenses. This may be useful to you or to your
          employer and make expense claiming easier.</p>
          <p>There is also the ability to add your VAT registration number
          to your account profile so that it is printed on relevant documents.</p>

          <h3>What happens if my internet is down?</h3>
          <p>BulldogClip is online software and so if your primary internet connection goes down you will need to find alternative internet access to use your account. With BulldogClip designed to be mobile friendly this shouldn't be too much of a problem. If you can't wait for the connection to be re-established we suggest you grab the opportunity to pop out for a coffee and use the internet there on your laptop or tablet.</p>
