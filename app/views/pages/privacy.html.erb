            <h3 'Source Sans Pro'>What is an IP address?</h3>
            <p>Each Internet connection is identified by a unique address which is referred to as an IP address (Internet Protocol address).</p>
            <br>
            <p>An IP address is made up of four numbers, separated by dots, for example: 87.124.10.1. This address allows any website visitor to be identified with the co-operation of the relevant Internet Service Provider (ISP). In practice an ISP would not give out this information because they would be in breach of the Data Protection Act. You should be aware that it is technically possible to connect an IP with a user with the help of a court order and the relevant ISP.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Some ISPs publish the name of the company or individual who uses the connection which allows anyone to see who is using that IP from central registries held by R.I.P.E. and other Regional Internet Registries (RIR). You can check if your IP address is listed using the whois service provided by all RIRs.</p>
