          <h3>Technology</h3>
          <p>For those with a technical bent. Our preferred platform for rapid
          agile development is Ruby on Rails. We work with HTML5, CSS3, 
          Javascript and JQuery. We use Cucumber and Rspec for Behaviour 
          Driven/Test Driven development. BulldogClip is hosted on Heroku. 
          Images are stored on Amazon S3. All the videos were created by us
          using VideoScribe or Screenflow. Most of the artwork is our own.
          We use Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and a range of other drawing tools.</p>
